"""
Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers on the market such as Chrome/Chromium, Firefox,
Internet Explorer, Edge, and Safari. Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser using the browserâ€™s built-in support
for automation.

Since all the driver implementations except for Internet Explorer are provided by the browser vendors themselves,
they are not included in the standard Selenium distribution. This section explains the basic requirements for getting
started with the different browsers.

Four Ways to Use Drivers:
    1. Selenium Manager (Beta)
    Selenium Manager helps you to get a working environment to run Selenium out of the box. Beta 1 of Selenium Manager
    will configure the drivers for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge if they are not found on the PATH. No extra configuration
    is needed. Future releases of Selenium Manager will eventually even download browsers if necessary.

    2. Driver Management Software
    Most machines automatically update the browser, but the driver does not. To make sure you get the correct driver
    for your browser, there are many third party libraries to assist you.

    3. The PATH Environment Variable
    This option first requires manually downloading the driver.
    This is a flexible option to change location of drivers without having to update your code, and will work on
    multiple machines without requiring that each machine put the drivers in the same place.
    You can either place the drivers in a directory that is already listed in PATH, or you can place them in a
    directory and add it to PATH.

    4. Hard Coded Location
    Similar to Option 3 above, you need to manually download the driver.
    Specifying the location in the code itself has the advantage of not needing to figure out Environment Variables on
    your system, but has the drawback of making the code much less flexible.
